                This site includes the two documentes that were submitted by me and my team - SPECTech - in the international competition
                for High School physics students all over the World, the video presentation and the conclusion about the study.
                <p>
                    Our proposal had the aim to observe the effect of temperature variations, at relatively extreme levels, on the trajectory,
                    speed, and energy of protons to study the influence that these results may have in medical
                    applications, specially related to cancer.
                </p>
